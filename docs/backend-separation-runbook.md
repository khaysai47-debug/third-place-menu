# Backend Separation Runbook — Phases 2B → 2H

**Status:** runbook — the checklist actually followed during migration.
Background/architecture lives in `docs/backend-separation-map.md`; data
contracts in `src/lib/data/contracts/`; parity procedure in
`docs/adapter-parity-testing.md`.

**Standing rules for every phase below:**

- The data-source switch is SPLIT (Phase 2E prep): `ACTIVE_READ_SOURCE` stays
  `"n8n"` until the Phase 2E gate passes, and only reads flip then;
  `ACTIVE_WRITE_SOURCE` stays `"n8n"` until Phase 2G — NEVER set it to
  "supabase" while the Supabase write methods are stubs.
- No n8n URL/slug changes at any point (`src/lib/n8n.ts` is live production).
- Owner dashboard stays manual-refresh-only; staff keeps its 5s poll. Polling
  changes are product decisions, never migration side effects.
- One phase per commit (or more), never two phases in one commit.

---

## Phase 2B — Schema discovery  *(no code changes)*

- Follow `docs/schema-discovery-guide.md` in n8n Cloud
  (https://shanchin.app.n8n.cloud) — read-only inspection of workflows +
  executions.
- Output: filled worksheet → `docs/schema-discovery-notes.md`.
- Exit criteria: every `DISCOVERY_REQUIRED` marker in
  `supabaseOrdersAdapter.ts` / `supabaseExpensesAdapter.ts` /
  `orderMapper.ts` / `expenseMapper.ts` / `normalize.ts` has an answer or an
  explicit `NOT FOUND`.

## Phase 2C — Implement Supabase READ adapter behind the inactive switch  *(DONE 2026-07-06)*

- Client: `src/lib/data/supabase.ts` — a plain-fetch PostgREST SELECT helper,
  deliberately **no `@supabase/supabase-js` dependency** (two REST reads don't
  justify it; revisit at Phase 2G if writes/auth/realtime demand the SDK).
  Env is read lazily per-request, so the app builds and runs without Supabase
  env while `ACTIVE_READ_SOURCE` is `"n8n"`; calling the adapter without env
  throws a clear developer error.
- Env vars (in `.env.local`, values never committed):
  `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (anon key ONLY — the
  service-role key stays in n8n; RLS posture still to confirm before 2E).
- `SupabaseOrderRow` / `SupabaseExpenseRow` aligned with the worksheet;
  `DB_STATUS_USES_COMPLETED = true` (verified: DB stores "completed", never
  "done"). orderKey = `orders.order_number` ("TP-…"), NOT the row UUID —
  the n8n write workflows match by order_number, so this keeps staff actions
  working during the mixed phase (Supabase reads + n8n writes).
- ONLY `listOrders()` and `listExpenses()` implemented (reads throw on
  failure). All writes remain `AdapterNotImplementedError` stubs.
- The data-source switch remains `"n8n"` — production is untouched by this commit.
- Exit criteria: app builds; live app behavior unchanged; Supabase reads
  callable directly in dev. ✓

## Phase 2D — Side-by-side parity comparison  *(no flip yet)*

**Status 2026-07-06: first-day parity PASSED** — `npm run parity` and
`npm run parity -- --strict` both `ok: true`: orders 38/38 clean matches,
expenses 0 vs 0 (trivially — re-test on a day with real expense rows).
Supabase-side setup done for read parity: `GRANT SELECT` + permissive anon
SELECT RLS policies (`USING (true)`) on `orders` and `order_items`.
⚠️ Revisit the RLS/security posture before real restaurant use — current anon
read exposure equals the existing public n8n staff-orders GET, but it was
enabled for testing, not decided for production. `ACTIVE_READ_SOURCE` and
`ACTIVE_WRITE_SOURCE` remain `"n8n"`; reads flip only via the Phase 2E gate
below; writes stay on n8n until Phase 2G.

Remaining before the 2E gate: second day of data, expenses with real rows,
a payment-proof order, one walk of docs/adapter-contract-checklist.md.

- Run the full procedure in `docs/adapter-parity-testing.md` — normally
  `npm run parity` (Node script `scripts/run-parity.mjs`, avoids browser
  CORS against n8n Cloud); compare functions live in
  `src/lib/data/dev/adapterParity.ts`.
- Also walk the human checklist `docs/adapter-contract-checklist.md`.
- Exit criteria: `ok: true` for orders AND expenses on ≥2 different days of
  real data, including delivery / cancelled / transfer-paid / proof orders;
  every mismatch explained and fixed at the adapter (never in the UI).

## Phase 2E — Flip READS only  *(FLIPPED 2026-07-06 — reads Supabase, writes n8n)*

`ACTIVE_READ_SOURCE = "supabase"`, `ACTIVE_WRITE_SOURCE = "n8n"` as of the
flip commit. Post-flip build/typecheck/parity/strict all passed. Deployed
verification ("Test immediately after flipping" below) is the human step
after the Vercel env vars are confirmed. Phase 2F stabilization starts now.

### Must ALL pass before flipping (gate)

Exact procedures for the first four: docs/adapter-parity-testing.md
§ "Final pre-flip QA" (QA-1…QA-4). The parity runner's `[coverage]` block
tracks which scenarios are still unexercised.

- [x] **QA-1 real-expense parity** — ✅ DONE 2026-07-06: expenses 1/1 clean
      (normal and `--strict`). Along the way: `expenses` needed its own anon
      GRANT + RLS policy, and the n8n-output/frontend-mapper key drift was
      fixed in the live mapper (blank expense names repaired) — details in
      the parity doc's Run log + "Known differences".
- [x] **QA-2 payment-proof parity** — ✅ DONE 2026-07-06: proof row inserted
      via the n8n webhook (keyed by `orders.id` UUID), proof fields clean on
      both sides, coverage `proofs=1`; `payment_proofs` anon SELECT + policy
      confirmed (risk register #6 closed).
- [x] **QA-3 second-day parity** — absorbed into Phase 2F by owner decision
      at flip time (2026-07-06): full same-day coverage was judged
      sufficient; re-run `npm run parity` on a later service day during 2F
      (n8n read webhooks stay alive, so the comparison remains meaningful).
- [x] **QA-4 RLS/security review** — corrected by the verified 2026-07-17 live
      snapshot: the four read tables had permissive anon SELECT policies plus
      unnecessary anon/authenticated table privileges. RLS blocked writes
      because no matching write policies existed. service_role stayed
      server-side. ⚠️ Full auth/RLS hardening is a
      separate pre-production task (parity doc QA-4) — still open, but not a
      flip blocker.
- [x] One `{ strictTimestamps: true }` run passing — multiple strict runs
      passed, incl. the full-coverage flip-gate run.
- [x] Every parity mismatch adjudicated — the QA-1 expense mapper drift was
      fixed in the live frontend mapper (parity doc "Known differences");
      no open mismatches.
- [x] Contract checklist — superseded by the machine parity checks, which
      compare every field the checklist lists, on full coverage (owner
      decision at flip time; docs/adapter-contract-checklist.md remains for
      reference).
- [ ] **HUMAN STEP AT DEPLOY:** Vercel project env has ALL THREE (values
      from the password manager, never from the repo — template:
      `.env.example`): `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
      (anon public key — NEVER service_role/sb_secret), and the existing
      `VITE_N8N_BASE_URL` (writes still go to n8n after the flip!).
      ⚠️ After the flip, a deploy WITHOUT the two Supabase vars breaks every
      dashboard read (clear error + retry UI, but broken nonetheless).
- [x] `npm run build` and `npm run typecheck` pass (re-verified at flip).

### The flip itself (one small commit)

The read/write switch split already exists (`src/lib/data/dataSource.ts`,
done as Phase 2E prep). The flip is:

1. Set `ACTIVE_READ_SOURCE = "supabase"` in `src/lib/data/dataSource.ts`.
   `ACTIVE_WRITE_SOURCE` stays `"n8n"` — do NOT touch it; the Supabase write
   methods are throwing stubs, so flipping it breaks every staff action.
2. `npm run build` and `npm run typecheck` must pass.
3. `npm run parity` one final time the same day — fresh proof that both
   sources agree at the moment of the flip.
4. Local smoke test (`npm run dev`): staff board, owner dashboard (manual
   refresh), customer menu render; a status update still works (n8n write).
   Note: after this flip local READS come from Supabase and work locally;
   local n8n WRITES may still be CORS-blocked from localhost — deployed
   verification (step 6) is where writes are properly confirmed.
5. Confirm the Vercel env gate item (all three `VITE_*` vars), then deploy.
6. Verify on the deployed Vercel app: run the "Test immediately after
   flipping" list below.
7. Nothing to delete: the parity runner lives in `src/lib/data/dev/` and is
   imported by nothing in the app, so it ships nowhere.

### Test immediately after flipping

- Staff board renders the same orders as before the flip (spot-check counts
  and one delivery + one cancelled order's fields).
- Owner dashboard (manual refresh only — unchanged): Today totals, payment
  mix, cancelled-today count match the pre-flip values on the same data.
- Expense view shows today's expenses; owner Net Today unchanged.
- ALL writes still work via n8n: advance a status, cancel with reason,
  record a payment, add an expense — and the n8n automations behind them
  (notifications) demonstrably still fire.
- Payment proof visibility: the QA-2 test proof (if kept) still shows its
  link on the staff card / owner order detail, and the link opens.
- Customer menu + checkout untouched and working (they never used the
  repository read path).

### Do NOT touch in this phase

- Writes (Phase 2G), order intake `submitOrder` (last of all, maybe never).
- n8n URLs/slugs (`src/lib/n8n.ts`), owner manual-refresh, staff 5s poll.
- Menu availability (stays on n8n until its own phase).

### Rollback (instant, exact steps)

1. In `src/lib/data/dataSource.ts`: set `ACTIVE_READ_SOURCE = "n8n"`.
2. `ACTIVE_WRITE_SOURCE` is already `"n8n"` — leave it.
3. `npm run build`
4. `npm run typecheck`
5. `git commit`
6. `git push` / redeploy on Vercel.

The n8n read webhooks stay alive until Phase 2H exactly for this. Capture
what forced the rollback in the risk register before retrying.

## Phase 2F — Production-like read testing

- Run the app against real data for several service days without code changes.
- Watch: order counts vs n8n, owner daily totals (gross, net, payment mix),
  cancelled-order exclusion, delivery fee display, proof links opening.
- Keep the n8n read webhooks alive as the instant rollback path.
- Exit criteria: a written "reads are stable" note with dates; no unexplained
  discrepancies.

## Phase 2G — Migrate writes, separately and one at a time

**Full plan: `docs/write-separation-plan.md`** (2G-A audit done 2026-07-06:
six normal-op writes W1–W6, one automation write W7 that stays on n8n
forever, plus R1 — menu-availability READS, incl. the customer menu, still
on n8n and bundled into 2G-E).

- Write path (DECIDED 2G-B, 2026-07-06): **server API routes inside this
  app** (TanStack Start already ships a nitro server on Vercel) — write key
  stays server-side (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, never `VITE_*`), payloads
  validated, staff writes behind a shared staff secret
  (`STAFF_WRITE_SECRET`, `x-staff-secret` header). Anon key remains
  read-only forever; no broad anon write grants.
- Side-effect audit (docs/n8n-workflow-side-effects.md, 2G-B): all five
  normal-op write workflows are DB-only today — no notifications/bot nodes
  exist yet, so nothing needs duplicating; a 60-second CONFIRM check in n8n
  precedes each individual migration. Payment proof stays n8n permanently.
- Checklist: 2G-A audit ✅ → 2G-B write path ✅ → 2G-C order submit
  (implement AFTER 2G-D unless intake automation is re-pointed — intake is
  the automation-entangled write; today none exists, but confirm at
  migration time) → 2G-D staff order actions → 2G-E expenses + menu
  availability (write + read) → 2G-F automation stays in n8n → 2G-G write
  smoke test + parity re-run.
- Every write keeps the never-throw `{ success, error? }` contract. Orders
  are keyed by `order_number` (TP-…), menu items by `item_code` — never by
  row UUID from the frontend.
- CAUTION: n8n automations (notifications, bot replies) currently trigger off
  n8n writes. Before moving any write, confirm in the n8n workflow what else
  it does besides the DB write, and re-point that automation (e.g. Supabase
  DB webhook → n8n, or the server route calls n8n) first.
- Exit criteria per write: plan § 4 walked — row values match what n8n would
  have written, read paths show it, dependent automation still fires,
  `npm run parity` still passes.

### 2G-D — Staff order server routes PREPARED (2026-07-08, not flipped)

Status: routes + Supabase write adapter implemented; **`ACTIVE_WRITE_SOURCE`
remains `"n8n"`** — the n8n write path is unchanged and stays the active
default and the rollback path. Production behavior is identical to before
this commit.

What exists now:

- Server routes (POST, server-side only, in `src/routes/`):
  - `/api/staff/update-status` — `{ orderId, status, cancellationReason? }`;
    validates against the app's 7 statuses; writes `orders.status`
    ("done" stored as "completed"); non-cancel statuses reset
    `cancellation_reason`/`cancelled_at` to null (n8n parity).
  - `/api/staff/cancel-order` — `{ orderId, reason? }`; status "cancelled" +
    `cancellation_reason` (default "Other") + `cancelled_at` now.
  - `/api/staff/mark-paid` — `{ orderId, paymentMethod: "Cash"|"Transfer" }`;
    `payment_status` "Paid", `payment_method`, `paid_at` now.
  - All match rows by `orders.order_number` (the frontend orderId, "TP-…") —
    never a client-sent UUID. Responses are `{ ok: true, … }` or
    `{ ok: false, error }` with proper status codes (400/401/404/500); no
    stack traces or env values ever reach the client.
- Auth: every route requires the `x-staff-secret` header and compares it to
  `STAFF_WRITE_SECRET`. Missing/wrong → 401. Missing env → safe 500.
- Server-only env vars (`.env.example` has the names): `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
  and `STAFF_WRITE_SECRET`, read via `process.env` inside
  `api/_lib/staffOrderWrites.server.ts` only — never `VITE_*`, never in the
  client bundle. The anon key remains read-only; the frontend never writes
  Supabase directly.
- Supabase adapter (`supabaseOrdersAdapter`): the three staff write stubs are
  now real — they POST to the routes above with the device's staff secret
  (localStorage, entered via the small ⚿ button in the staff header;
  empty prompt clears it). `submitOrder` stays a stub (2G-C, last).
- Per-device test override (no global flip): in the staff device's console,
  `localStorage.setItem("tp-staff-write-source", "supabase")` routes the three
  staff actions through the new path on THAT DEVICE only;
  `localStorage.removeItem("tp-staff-write-source")` reverts instantly.

Manual local test checklist (secrets typed into the shell/prompt only —
never committed):

1. `.env.local` has `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` + `STAFF_WRITE_SECRET`
   (plus the three `VITE_*` vars). `npm run dev`.
2. curl (replace TP-… with a real dev order; `$STAFF_WRITE_SECRET` from your
   shell env, not pasted inline):
   ```sh
   curl -i -X POST http://localhost:5173/api/staff/update-status \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "x-staff-secret: $STAFF_WRITE_SECRET" \
     -d '{"orderId":"TP-XXXX","status":"preparing"}'
   curl -i -X POST http://localhost:5173/api/staff/mark-paid \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "x-staff-secret: $STAFF_WRITE_SECRET" \
     -d '{"orderId":"TP-XXXX","paymentMethod":"Cash"}'
   curl -i -X POST http://localhost:5173/api/staff/cancel-order \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "x-staff-secret: $STAFF_WRITE_SECRET" \
     -d '{"orderId":"TP-XXXX","reason":"Test"}'
   ```
   Also verify the failure modes: wrong/missing secret → 401; unknown
   orderId → 404; bad status/method → 400.
3. UI path: on the staff page, tap ⚿ and enter the secret; in the console set
   the `tp-staff-write-source` override; advance / mark paid / cancel an
   order; verify the row in Supabase Table Editor matches what n8n would have
   written (status/completed spelling, cancellation fields, paid_at).
4. Revert the device: remove the localStorage override. n8n writes work again
   immediately (nothing was changed on that path).

**Production flip is a LATER step** — after deployed testing, the n8n
CONFIRM checkbox (docs/n8n-workflow-side-effects.md rows 2–3), and the
deployment prerequisite below. Rollback at any point: the override off /
`ACTIVE_WRITE_SOURCE` back to `"n8n"` — n8n webhooks are untouched.

**Deployment prerequisite — RESOLVED in 2G-D2 (2026-07-08), see below.**

### 2G-D2 — Vercel API routing for /api/staff/* FIXED (2026-07-08)

Investigation confirmed the 2G-D warning as fact: the deploy was static-only.
The Lovable vite wrapper (`@lovable.dev/vite-tanstack-config`) only runs its
Nitro deploy plugin when a `nitro` option is set explicitly in
`vite.config.ts` or when building inside a Lovable sandbox — on Vercel CI
neither holds, so no server function was ever built or deployed, and the
`vercel.json` catch-all rewrite sent `/api/staff/*` to `/_shell.html`
(POST → the SPA shell as HTML, handlers never ran).

**Failed first attempt (reverted — do not retry):** `nitro: { preset:
"vercel" }` in `vite.config.ts`. It emitted a correct `.vercel/output/`, but
moved the SSR bundle out of `dist/server/` — and TanStack's SPA-shell
prerender (forced on whenever `spa.enabled`) starts a vite preview server
that imports `dist/server/server.js`. Clean builds (locally and on Vercel)
died in prerender with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND → "Failed to fetch /". The
initial local "pass" had loaded a STALE `dist/server/server.js` from a
pre-nitro build. Lesson recorded: always verify deploy-config changes with
`rm -rf dist .vercel/output` first.

The actual fix — native Vercel functions, one shared implementation:

- `api/_lib/staffOrderWrites.server.ts` contains the COMPLETE handlers as
  web-standard `(Request) => Response` functions (`postUpdateStatus`,
  `postCancelOrder`, `postMarkPaid`, plus `methodNotAllowed` → 405 JSON for
  non-POST verbs). It is deliberately self-contained (zod + `process.env`
  only; no vite aliases, no `import.meta.env`) so it bundles identically
  under vite and under Vercel's function builder.
- LOCATION MATTERS (second production crash, fixed 2026-07-08): the module
  first lived in `src/lib/` and the function compiled to ESM with an
  extensionless import of a file outside `api/` → runtime
  ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND (`/var/task/src/lib/staffOrderWrites.server`).
  Vercel's builder only reliably compiles TS inside `api/`, and Node ESM
  does no extension resolution. Rules: shared function code lives under
  `api/_lib/` (underscore = not exposed as a route), and `api/staff/*.ts`
  imports it WITH the `.js` extension.
- Two thin delegate surfaces, zero duplicated logic:
  - `src/routes/api.staff.*.ts` — TanStack Start server routes (dev),
    importing the same `api/_lib` module.
  - `api/staff/*.ts` — native Vercel functions (production). Vercel builds
    the `api/` directory alongside ANY framework output, so the static SPA
    deploy itself is byte-identical to what has been live for weeks.
- `vercel.json`: catch-all rewrite stays narrowed to `/((?!api/).*)` —
  functions match before rewrites anyway, but this keeps `/api/*` fail-loud.
- The Supabase URL is read from `process.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL` (public
  config; the same project env var is available to function runtimes).

Local verification (2026-07-08, clean `rm -rf dist .vercel/output` build):
`npm run build` + typecheck pass; dev-server curls — no secret → 401 JSON,
bad status → 400, unknown order → 404 on cancel AND mark-paid (proving the
`process.env` → Supabase chain end-to-end). Client bundle greps clean of
`STAFF_WRITE_SECRET` / service-role references.

Verify after the next Vercel deploy (before any staff-write testing):

1. `POST https://<prod>/api/staff/update-status` with no secret → 401 JSON
   (NOT an HTML shell response — that would mean the function isn't serving).
2. Staff board / owner dashboard / customer menu still render and read data.
3. A status update via the normal UI still works (n8n write path unchanged).
4. Vercel project env must now also hold the server-only vars when write
   testing starts: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `STAFF_WRITE_SECRET`
   (server env — never `VITE_*`), and `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` must be exposed to
   the production runtime (it already exists for builds).

Rollback: delete the `api/` directory and revert the commit — the static SPA
deploy is unaffected either way (n8n writes were never touched).

### 2G-E — Controlled staff write testing on production (2026-07-08)

(Owner phase naming. The write-separation-plan's original "2G-E — expenses +
menu availability" is untouched and becomes the NEXT implementation phase.)

**RESULT: PASSED (2026-07-08).** Test order `TP-S-20260708-152853`, on the
deployed production app, writes still on n8n throughout:

- `POST /api/staff/update-status` with `x-staff-secret` → `ok: true`,
  status became `preparing`. ✅
- `POST /api/staff/mark-paid` with `Cash` → ✅; then `Transfer`
  (overwrite) → ✅.
- `POST /api/staff/cancel-order` with reason "2G-E test cleanup" → ✅
  (test order ends cancelled = excluded from owner money totals).
- Staff / owner / customer pages all still loaded. ✅
- `ACTIVE_WRITE_SOURCE` remained `"n8n"`; NO global write flip happened —
  normal production writes went through n8n the whole time. ✅
- **Production staff server writes are confirmed working end-to-end**
  (auth → validation → Supabase PATCH by order_number → JSON result).
- SECURITY: `STAFF_WRITE_SECRET` was ROTATED after the test because the
  value appeared in a screenshot/chat; after redeploy, POST without the
  secret still returns 401 (auth confirmed working with the new value).
  Standing rule: rotate the secret any time it is displayed anywhere.

**Next phase: the TARGETED staff write flip** (decision gate below):

- Do NOT flip `ACTIVE_WRITE_SOURCE` globally — `submitOrder` (customer
  checkout + staff manual order) still needs n8n; the global flag would
  route it to the throwing Supabase stub and break order intake.
- Rebind ONLY `updateOrderStatus` / `cancelOrder` / `updateOrderPayment` in
  `src/lib/data/orderRepository.ts` to the Supabase route adapter.
- `submitOrder` stays on n8n. n8n status/payment webhooks stay alive as the
  instant fallback/rollback path.

Production writes remain on n8n throughout — every test below targets ONE
disposable test order, keyed by its `order_number`, through the deployed
`/api/staff/*` functions.

**Already verified on production (2026-07-08):**

- `POST /api/staff/update-status` without `x-staff-secret` → 401 JSON.
- `GET /api/staff/update-status` → 405 JSON.
- `/`, `/staff`, `/owner` all load; reads work.
- Vercel env has `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` + `STAFF_WRITE_SECRET`.

**Route contracts under test** (single implementation:
`api/_lib/staffOrderWrites.server.ts`; all match rows by
`orders.order_number`, never a UUID):

| Route | Body | Columns written |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/staff/update-status` | `{ orderId, status, cancellationReason? }` — status ∈ the app's 7 values | non-cancel: `status` ("done"→`completed`) + `cancellation_reason`/`cancelled_at` reset to null; "cancelled": as cancel-order |
| `POST /api/staff/cancel-order` | `{ orderId, reason? }` | `status="cancelled"`, `cancellation_reason` (reason or "Other"), `cancelled_at=now` — payment fields untouched (n8n parity) |
| `POST /api/staff/mark-paid` | `{ orderId, paymentMethod: "Cash"\|"Transfer" }` | `payment_status="Paid"`, `payment_method`, `paid_at=now` |

**Step 0 — create the test order** (never test on a customer order): staff
page → Add Order 加單 → one cheapest item, dine-in, note
`TEST ORDER 2G-E — do not prepare`. This uses the untouched n8n intake, so
the row is created exactly like production rows. Note its `TP-…` number.
Prefer testing outside service hours (mid-test the transient Paid state
counts in owner Today until the final cancel).

**Step 1 — API tests** (PowerShell; secret via Read-Host so it never enters
shell history — never paste secrets inline):

```powershell
$env:STAFF_SECRET = Read-Host "Paste STAFF_WRITE_SECRET from .env.local"
$env:BASE_URL = "https://third-place-menu.vercel.app"
$env:TEST_ORDER = "TP-XXXX"   # <-- the Step 0 order number
$H = @{ "x-staff-secret" = $env:STAFF_SECRET }

# A) status update
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "$env:BASE_URL/api/staff/update-status" -Headers $H -ContentType "application/json" -Body (@{ orderId = $env:TEST_ORDER; status = "preparing" } | ConvertTo-Json)
# B) mark paid Cash
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "$env:BASE_URL/api/staff/mark-paid" -Headers $H -ContentType "application/json" -Body (@{ orderId = $env:TEST_ORDER; paymentMethod = "Cash" } | ConvertTo-Json)
# C) mark paid Transfer (overwrite)
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "$env:BASE_URL/api/staff/mark-paid" -Headers $H -ContentType "application/json" -Body (@{ orderId = $env:TEST_ORDER; paymentMethod = "Transfer" } | ConvertTo-Json)
# D) cancel — final state doubles as cleanup (cancelled = excluded from owner money)
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "$env:BASE_URL/api/staff/cancel-order" -Headers $H -ContentType "application/json" -Body (@{ orderId = $env:TEST_ORDER; reason = "2G-E test cleanup" } | ConvertTo-Json)
```

Expected: every call returns `ok: True` (Invoke-RestMethod throws on
non-2xx). After A: `status="preparing"`, cancellation fields null. After B:
`payment_status="Paid"`, `payment_method="Cash"`, `paid_at` stamped. After
C: `payment_method="Transfer"`, `paid_at` newer. After D:
`status="cancelled"`, `cancellation_reason="2G-E test cleanup"`,
`cancelled_at` stamped, payment fields unchanged.

**Step 2 — Supabase Table Editor verification**: `orders` table, filter
`order_number = TP-XXXX`; after each call check `status`,
`payment_status`, `payment_method`, `paid_at`, `cancellation_reason`,
`cancelled_at` against the expected values above. Timestamps ISO, sane.

**Step 3 — UI-path test on a staff device** (exercises the Supabase adapter
end-to-end, per-device only): on `/staff`, tap ⚿ and enter the staff
secret; in the browser console run
`localStorage.setItem("tp-staff-write-source", "supabase")`. Re-run Step 0
to make a second test order, then advance / mark paid / cancel it FROM THE
UI. Verify the board updates optimistically and survives the 5s poll
(reads are Supabase, so what you wrote is what it reads). Then
`localStorage.removeItem("tp-staff-write-source")` and confirm a normal n8n
write still works on some other harmless action.

**Step 4 — owner dashboard**: manual refresh; both test orders sit in
cancelled (excluded from gross/net/payment mix); cancelled-today count
includes them (expected).

**Rollback / reset**: the final cancelled state IS the cleanup — no reset
needed. To reset a field manually anyway: Table Editor → orders → the row →
edit the columns listed in Step 2 (e.g. `payment_status` back to `unpaid`,
`payment_method`/`paid_at` to NULL). Full removal, ONLY if desired, via SQL
editor — review before running, children first:

```sql
-- shown for reference; do not run without checking the order_number twice
DELETE FROM order_items WHERE order_id = (SELECT id FROM orders WHERE order_number = 'TP-XXXX');
DELETE FROM orders WHERE order_number = 'TP-XXXX';
```

**Decision gate — before flipping staff writes to Supabase:**

- [ ] Step 1 A–D all `ok: True` with matching Supabase rows (Step 2).
- [ ] Step 3 UI-path test passed on the actual staff device.
- [ ] n8n CONFIRM checkboxes for the two workflows being replaced
      (docs/n8n-workflow-side-effects.md rows 2–3): 60-second node-list
      check that they are still DB-only.
- [ ] ⚠️ FLIP DESIGN (confirmed 2026-07-08): do NOT flip
      `ACTIVE_WRITE_SOURCE` — that would also route `submitOrder` (customer
      checkout + manual order) to the Supabase adapter where it is still a
      THROWING STUB and would break order intake. The staff flip is a small
      code change in `src/lib/data/orderRepository.ts` binding ONLY
      `updateOrderStatus` / `cancelOrder` / `updateOrderPayment` to
      `supabaseOrdersAdapter` (replacing the localStorage override),
      while `ACTIVE_WRITE_SOURCE` stays `"n8n"` for `submitOrder`.
- [ ] Staff devices provisioned: secret entered via ⚿ on each device BEFORE
      the flip deploys (writes fail with a clear error otherwise).
- [ ] n8n status/payment webhooks stay alive as instant rollback.

### 2G-F — TARGETED staff-write flip (2026-07-08)

Staff order actions (status / cancel / mark-paid) now default to the
Supabase server routes via a NEW switch in `src/lib/data/dataSource.ts`:

- `STAFF_ACTION_WRITE_SOURCE = "supabase"` — governs exactly the staff
  actions; deliberately separate from `ACTIVE_WRITE_SOURCE` (still `"n8n"`),
  which still governs `submitOrder` (customer checkout + staff manual order)
  because the Supabase `submitOrder` is a throwing stub.
- The 2G-D per-device localStorage override (`tp-staff-write-source`) was
  REMOVED — superseded by the one constant. The ⚿ secret flow is unchanged;
  a device without the secret gets a clear "tap the key button" error.
- ROLLBACK (one line): `STAFF_ACTION_WRITE_SOURCE` back to `"n8n"`, build,
  deploy. The n8n adapters/webhooks were never modified.
- ⚠️ PROVISIONING: every staff device must have the current
  `STAFF_WRITE_SECRET` entered via ⚿ BEFORE this deploy serves it.

### 2G-G — Expense write server route + targeted flip (2026-07-08)

Pre-check passed: the n8n Add Expense workflow is DB-only (side-effects doc
row 4, rec. A) — safe to move.

- New route `POST /api/staff/add-expense` (same delegate pattern:
  `api/staff/add-expense.ts` for production, `src/routes/
  api.staff.add-expense.ts` for dev, one implementation in
  `api/_lib/staffOrderWrites.server.ts`). Requires `x-staff-secret`;
  validates the frozen snake_case payload (`item_name`, positive `amount`,
  closed `paid_from`/`category` vocabularies, optional `note`/`created_by`).
- INSERT mapping replicates n8n (schema notes § Expenses): `expense_date` ←
  Bangkok yyyy-MM-dd, `description` ← item_name, `payment_method` ←
  paid_from, `staff_name` ← created_by or "Staff", `note`. Returns
  `{ ok: true, expenseId }` (the row UUID — the app's expenseId).
- `supabaseExpensesAdapter.addExpense` implemented via the shared
  `staffWriteClient`; `expenseRepository.addExpense` follows
  `STAFF_ACTION_WRITE_SOURCE` — same one-line rollback as 2G-F.
- Dev-verified: 401 without secret, 400 on bad paid_from and negative
  amount; order routes regression-checked (404 unknown order).

### 2G-H — Menu availability: schema fix + migration (implemented 2026-07-14)

Problem (decision recorded 2026-07-08): the app has three states —
`Available` / `Sold Out` / `Hidden` (`src/lib/menuAvailability.ts`) — but
the DB had only `menu_items.is_available` **boolean**. The n8n write
collapses the states (`is_available ← status === "Available"`) and the n8n
read maps the boolean back to only `Available`/`Sold Out` — **Hidden could
not round-trip**: a hidden item came back as Sold Out.

**Schema fix** — `menu_items.availability_status` text + CHECK
(`available` / `sold_out` / `hidden`; text beats an enum type — extending
later needs no type migration). REVIEW-FIRST SQL (backfill from the boolean,
verification SELECTs, rollback, anon read policy per plan R1):
`docs/sql/2026-07-14-2G-H-menu-availability-status.sql` — run MANUALLY in
the Supabase SQL editor, never by tooling.

- ⚠️ Backfill limitation: previously-hidden rows are `false` =
  indistinguishable from Sold Out; they backfill to `sold_out` and must be
  re-marked Hidden by hand (one-time manual review).

**Code (W6 + R1 together, one switch)** — `MENU_AVAILABILITY_SOURCE` in
`dataSource.ts` ("supabase") governs read AND write together so the two
columns can't drift:

- READ: `menu_items` via the anon key, EXPLICIT public columns only
  (`item_code,name_en,category,price,is_available,availability_status`;
  `sort_order` granted for ORDER BY) — never `select=*`. The SQL file grants
  anon a COLUMN-LIMITED SELECT (RLS enabled, all rows readable, only those
  columns; internal/cost/audit/future columns are unreadable by design;
  200-with-zero-rows means the policy is missing). If the deploy somehow
  precedes the migration, the read retries once without
  `availability_status` → boolean mapping. Transitional mapping: prefer
  `availability_status` when valid; else fall back `is_available` true→
  Available / false→Sold Out (the boolean never invents Hidden). Consumers:
  customer menu (drops Hidden, fails open to local data), staff Menu board
  (shows Hidden; 2G-H added a Hidden action button + filter so staff can
  hide/restore from the UI), manual-order picker (hides Hidden).
- WRITE: `POST /api/staff/update-menu-availability` (same delegate pattern:
  `api/staff/update-menu-availability.ts` production,
  `src/routes/api.staff.update-menu-availability.ts` dev, one implementation
  in `api/_lib/staffOrderWrites.server.ts`). Requires `x-staff-secret`
  (device secret via ⚿, sent by the shared staffWriteClient); zod-validates
  `menuItemId` + strict 3-value `availabilityStatus`; 404 on unknown
  item_code. DUAL-WRITES `availability_status` + `is_available` so n8n
  workflows/old readers keep working; retire the boolean in Phase 2H.
- Unchanged: customer submitOrder + staff Add Order stay on n8n
  (`ACTIVE_WRITE_SOURCE` untouched); n8n menu webhooks stay alive as the
  rollback path.

**Deployment order (2G-H):** 1. review code + SQL → 2. run the SQL file in
Supabase SQL editor → 3. run its verification SELECTs → 4. build/typecheck →
5. deploy → 6. controlled production test (below) → 7. commit. The SQL must
land BEFORE the deploy: the new write route PATCHes `availability_status`
and fails (a safe 500, no data touched) while the column is missing, and the
read needs the anon policy.

**Rollback:** set `MENU_AVAILABILITY_SOURCE` back to `"n8n"`, build, deploy
— nothing else. Keep the column (dropping it discards hidden states — see
the SQL file § 4); while writes are on n8n, `availability_status` goes stale
and must be re-synced (SQL file § 5) before flipping forward again.

### Phase 2G-I — secure order intake (customer checkout + Staff Add Order, 2026-07-14)

The last normal-op write, IMPLEMENTED (code on branch; SQL review-first).
Architecture:

1. **Two server routes**, one shared implementation
   (`api/_lib/orderIntake.server.ts`, same dual-surface pattern as 2G-D2):
   - `POST /api/order/submit` — PUBLIC (customers aren't logged in);
   - `POST /api/staff/add-order` — requires `x-staff-secret`.
   Strict zod validation: request-id shape, order type, item-code format,
   integer quantities (≤20/item, ≤30 lines, ≤60 items), field length caps,
   JSON content type, 16 KB body cap, per-type required fields (dine_in →
   table; pickup → name+phone; delivery → name+phone+address), duplicate
   lines safely combined. dine_in never stores leftover customer data.
2. **The browser is not trusted for money**: the body carries ONLY item
   codes + quantities + order-type details. The route calls the
   `create_order_with_items` Postgres function
   (docs/sql/2026-07-14-2G-I-order-intake.sql) with the service-role key;
   the function re-reads `menu_items`, rejects unknown / sold_out / hidden /
   unpriced items, computes unit price, name snapshot, line totals,
   subtotal, delivery fee (fixed 30 THB delivery / 0 otherwise —
   delivery_zones holds demo rows and is deliberately not consulted), and
   total, and inserts `orders` + `order_items` in ONE transaction (no
   partial orders possible). EXECUTE is service_role-only.
3. **Server-generated order numbers**: `TP-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` (customer) /
   `TP-S-…` (staff) in Bangkok time, generated in the function with a
   suffix-retry against the unique `orders.order_number` constraint. The UI
   shows the RETURNED number (checkout success screen + manual-order form).
4. **Idempotency**: new `orders.client_request_id` (partial unique index).
   The frontend makes one `crypto.randomUUID()` per intended order and
   reuses it on retries; the function returns the ORIGINAL order for a
   replayed id (`duplicate: true`) — double-tap / network-retry safe.
5. **Stored defaults** match n8n behavior: status `new`, payment_status
   `unpaid`, payment_method null; source `customer_menu` (customer) /
   `staff_manual` (staff manual — NEW value, previously n8n wrote
   customer_menu for these; nothing reads `source` today).
6. **Switch**: `ORDER_INTAKE_SOURCE` in dataSource.ts governs ONLY
   submitOrder (checkout + manual order). `ACTIVE_WRITE_SOURCE` stays "n8n"
   and now governs nothing in practice.
7. **Automation bridge (optional, OFF by default)**: after a successful
   NON-duplicate insert the route emits a signed `order.created` event to
   `N8N_ORDER_AUTOMATION_WEBHOOK_URL` — upgraded in Phase 3A (next section)
   to short-lived-JWT-authenticated + `waitUntil`-backed delivery. ⚠️ NEVER
   point this at the
   old `third-place-order-test` webhook — its workflow INSERTS an order and
   every order would be duplicated. It needs a NEW automation-only workflow
   (no write nodes).

**Deployment order (2G-I):** 1. review code + SQL → 2. run
docs/sql/2026-07-14-2G-I-order-intake.sql in the Supabase SQL editor →
3. run its verification SELECTs (§ 4) → 4. typecheck/build → 5. deploy a
Preview branch and run the controlled test (below) → 6. verify stored
prices/totals in Table Editor came from menu_items → 7. check the n8n
executions list shows NO new order-intake executions from app orders →
8. clean up test orders (cancel or delete rows) → 9. merge to main.
The SQL must land BEFORE the deploy: without the RPC the new routes fail
with a safe 500 and write nothing.

**Controlled test (Preview):**
- Customer dine-in / pickup / delivery order (one each, disposable): success
  screen shows the SERVER order number; row + items + totals correct in
  Table Editor; delivery total = subtotal + 30.
- Staff Add Order (needs ⚿ secret on the device): TP-S-… number returned,
  board refreshes.
- Price manipulation: POST to /api/order/submit with fake
  unitPrice/totalPrice fields (they're not even in the schema — stripped)
  and verify stored totals are menu prices; POST a sold_out item-code →
  409, no row.
- Idempotency: repeat an identical POST (same requestId) → same
  order_number, `duplicate: true`, ONE row.

**Rollback:** set `ORDER_INTAKE_SOURCE` back to `"n8n"`, build, deploy —
intake returns to the untouched n8n webhook (client still sends the full
legacy payload). The SQL objects are harmless to leave in place. n8n-created
orders have NULL client_request_id, so idempotency simply doesn't apply to
them.

### Phase 3A — signed order-created automation bridge (2026-07-14)

Code on branch (`api/_lib/orderIntake.server.ts`, `fireOrderAutomation`).
Purpose: after a successful NEW order transaction (customer OR staff), the
Vercel route notifies a NEW automation-only n8n webhook so Phase 3
bots/notifications can react — WITHOUT n8n ever inserting an order again.

**Behavior:**

- Fires only after `create_order_with_items` succeeded AND
  `duplicate` is false (idempotent replays never re-fire).
- Skipped silently unless BOTH `N8N_ORDER_AUTOMATION_WEBHOOK_URL` and
  `N8N_AUTOMATION_SECRET` are set (server-only env, never `VITE_*`).
- Delivery runs through Vercel `waitUntil` (`@vercel/functions`): the
  customer response returns immediately; the function stays alive until the
  webhook call finishes. Outside Vercel (dev server) `waitUntil` is a no-op
  and the long-lived process finishes the promise anyway.
- 5 s `AbortSignal.timeout`. Any failure (down, timeout, 500) is logged as
  safe metadata only (event id, order number, status / error NAME — never
  the URL, secret, JWT, body, or error message) and never changes the order
  response.
- Standalone check: `npm run test:bridge`
  (scripts/test-automation-bridge.mjs — JWT shape/signature + skip /
  single-event / duplicate / failure behavior with stubbed fetch).

**Event body:**

```json
{"eventId":"<uuid>","eventType":"order.created","occurredAt":"<ISO-8601>","orderNumber":"TP-...","channel":"customer|staff"}
```

No customer data, no money fields, no secrets. n8n fetches the
authoritative order from Supabase server-to-server using its own credential.

**Auth — short-lived HS256 JWT** (built with node:crypto, no jwt library;
verified by n8n's BUILT-IN Webhook JWT Auth + JWT node, so the secret lives
only in an n8n credential, never in workflow Code nodes, Variables, or
execution data). Signing input is
`base64url(header) + "." + base64url(claims)`, HMAC SHA-256 keyed with
`N8N_AUTOMATION_SECRET`, signature base64url-encoded. Header:
`{"alg":"HS256","typ":"JWT"}`. Claims:

```json
{
  "iss": "atlas-order-bridge",
  "aud": "n8n-order-automation",
  "sub": "order.created",
  "jti": "<eventId>",
  "iat": <unix seconds>,
  "nbf": <iat - 5>,
  "exp": <iat + 120>,
  "eventId": "<same eventId>",
  "eventType": "order.created",
  "occurredAt": "<same ISO timestamp>",
  "orderNumber": "TP-...",
  "channel": "customer|staff"
}
```

**Headers sent:** `Content-Type: application/json`,
`Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` (checked by n8n Webhook JWT Auth BEFORE the
workflow runs; the JWT Verify node reads the same header),
`x-atlas-event-id` (= body eventId), `x-atlas-timestamp` (= body
occurredAt).

**Test vector** (secret `test-secret`, clock frozen at
2026-07-14T12:00:00Z → iat 1784030400, nbf 1784030395, exp 1784030520;
event fields as in the body example with orderNumber
`TP-20260714-120000`, eventId `11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555`):

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJhdGxhcy1vcmRlci1icmlkZ2UiLCJhdWQiOiJuOG4tb3JkZXItYXV0b21hdGlvbiIsInN1YiI6Im9yZGVyLmNyZWF0ZWQiLCJqdGkiOiIxMTExMTExMS0yMjIyLTMzMzMtNDQ0NC01NTU1NTU1NTU1NTUiLCJpYXQiOjE3ODQwMzA0MDAsIm5iZiI6MTc4NDAzMDM5NSwiZXhwIjoxNzg0MDMwNTIwLCJldmVudElkIjoiMTExMTExMTEtMjIyMi0zMzMzLTQ0NDQtNTU1NTU1NTU1NTU1IiwiZXZlbnRUeXBlIjoib3JkZXIuY3JlYXRlZCIsIm9jY3VycmVkQXQiOiIyMDI2LTA3LTE0VDEyOjAwOjAwLjAwMFoiLCJvcmRlck51bWJlciI6IlRQLTIwMjYwNzE0LTEyMDAwMCIsImNoYW5uZWwiOiJjdXN0b21lciJ9.vUwdYkl9mU2-49NCJt2Z8bYpw8LHuPO-aQqgMPcG-Vs
```

Paste it into any offline JWT debugger with secret `test-secret` → signature
valid (the token itself is long expired — that's the point of exp). Or:

```
node -e "const{createHmac}=require('node:crypto');const[h,p,s]=process.argv[1].split('.');console.log(s===createHmac('sha256','test-secret').update(h+'.'+p).digest('base64url'))" '<jwt>'
```

**Manual n8n workflow plan (build in Phase 3B — NOT built yet).**
Hard rules first: NO raw HMAC/secret in any Code node, NO secret in n8n
Variables or execution data, never log JWT values, ZERO insert/update nodes
for `orders` / `order_items`, and never reuse or copy
`third-place-order-test` (it inserts orders).

1. **JWT credential** (Credentials → New → JWT): Key Type **Passphrase**,
   Algorithm **HS256**, Passphrase = the exact `N8N_AUTOMATION_SECRET`
   value. This credential is the ONLY place the secret exists in n8n.
2. **Webhook node**: method POST, a BRAND-NEW random path (e.g.
   `atlas-order-events-<random>`), Authentication: **JWT Auth** with the
   credential from step 1, Respond: **Immediately**. Invalid/missing
   `Authorization: Bearer` tokens are rejected BEFORE the workflow executes.
3. **JWT node**: Operation **Verify**, same JWT credential, token from the
   Authorization header minus the Bearer prefix:
   `{{ $json.headers.authorization.replace(/^Bearer\s+/i, '') }}`,
   Ignore Expiration **false**, Ignore Not Before **false**, clock
   tolerance **30 s**. Output = the signed claims.
4. **Validation Code node** (claims and body only — no secret): require
   `iss === "atlas-order-bridge"`, `aud === "n8n-order-automation"`,
   `sub === "order.created"`; require the verified claims' `eventId`,
   `eventType`, `occurredAt`, `orderNumber`, `channel` to EQUAL the parsed
   request-body fields, and `jti === eventId`. Throw on any mismatch so the
   execution fails visibly.
5. **Deduplicate via an n8n Data Table** (NOT workflow static data) named
   `atlas_order_events`, columns: `event_id` string, `occurred_at` date,
   `order_number` string, `channel` string. Look up `event_id`; if found →
   stop (already processed); else insert the row, then continue.
6. **HTTP Request node**: ~~fetch the authoritative order from Supabase
   REST using the existing secured n8n Supabase credential~~ — SUPERSEDED by
   Phase 3B (next section): n8n forwards the SAME incoming Bearer JWT to
   `POST /api/automation/order-details` and never holds a Supabase
   credential for this flow at all.
7. Attach bot/notification actions AFTER that fetch (Phase 3 work).
8. Set `N8N_ORDER_AUTOMATION_WEBHOOK_URL` (the new path's production URL)
   + `N8N_AUTOMATION_SECRET` (long random value, same as the credential
   passphrase) in Vercel env → redeploy → bridge goes live.

**Verification checklist (Preview deploy):**

- [ ] `npm run test:bridge` passes locally (JWT shape, independent HS256
      verification, exp = iat + 120, skip/duplicate/failure behavior).
- [ ] Env vars unset: place a disposable order → succeeds; logs show
      `ORDER_INTAKE` but NO `ORDER_AUTOMATION` line; n8n shows no execution.
- [ ] Both env vars set: one order → succeeds AND exactly one event
      arrives; n8n Webhook JWT Auth accepted it; the JWT Verify node
      returns claims matching the body.
- [ ] Wrong-secret probe: POST to the webhook with an unsigned/garbage
      Bearer token → n8n rejects it before the workflow runs (no execution
      with data).
- [ ] Idempotent replay (re-POST same requestId): `duplicate: true`, NO
      second event.
- [ ] Event replay (re-deliver the same eventId to n8n): dropped by the
      `atlas_order_events` Data Table lookup.
- [ ] Receiver returns 500: order still succeeds; log line says
      `rejected` with the status.
- [ ] Receiver hangs > 5 s: order still succeeds; log line says
      `failed: TimeoutError`.
- [ ] Test vector above validates in an offline JWT debugger with
      `test-secret`.

**Rollback:** unset the two env vars (bridge off, orders unaffected) or
revert the branch. No SQL, no data migration — the bridge is stateless.

### Phase 3B — authoritative order fetch for n8n (2026-07-15)

Code on branch (`api/_lib/orderDetails.server.ts` +
`api/_lib/orderEventJwt.server.ts`). Purpose: after n8n validates and
deduplicates a Phase 3A `order.created` event, it forwards the SAME
short-lived Bearer JWT to a new read-only Vercel endpoint and receives the
authoritative order + items as a deliberately mapped, safe payload. n8n
never holds a Supabase key for this flow; the service-role key stays
server-side in Vercel only.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/automation/order-details` — dual-surface like every
other route (native Vercel function `api/automation/order-details.ts`,
TanStack dev route `src/routes/api.automation.order-details.ts`, ONE shared
handler in `api/_lib/orderDetails.server.ts`). Server-to-server only: no
CORS headers, no OPTIONS handler, no browser auth. All non-POST verbs → 405.

**Request contract:**

- `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` — the UNMODIFIED token from the Phase 3A
  event delivery. Exact `Bearer ` scheme; missing/empty/malformed/repeated
  headers → generic 401.
- `Content-Type: application/json`; body ≤ 1024 bytes:

```json
{"eventId":"<uuid from the event>","orderNumber":"TP-..."}
```

- Strict zod validation: object only (arrays/null rejected), unknown fields
  rejected, `eventId` 8–64 chars of `[A-Za-z0-9-]`, `orderNumber` 4–64 chars
  of `[A-Za-z0-9-]` (charset admits no whitespace — padded values are
  rejected, not trimmed). No column names, filters, table names, or query
  text can be expressed in the body at all.

**JWT verification** (`verifyOrderEventJwt`, orderEventJwt.server.ts — the
same module Phase 3A signs with, so the two directions cannot drift):
exactly 3 base64url segments, ≤ 4096 bytes; header must be valid JSON with
`alg` EXACTLY `HS256` (`none` and everything else rejected); signature
recomputed with HMAC-SHA256 over `header.payload` keyed by
`N8N_AUTOMATION_SECRET` and compared with `crypto.timingSafeEqual`
(constant-time; length checked first); claims must satisfy
`iss=atlas-order-bridge`, `aud=n8n-order-automation`, `sub=order.created`,
`jti` present and equal to the `eventId` claim, `eventType=order.created`,
`channel` ∈ {customer, staff}, `occurredAt` a string; `exp`/`nbf`/`iat`
must be numbers, checked against a documented **30 s clock tolerance**
(`JWT_CLOCK_TOLERANCE_S`): expired, nbf-in-the-future, and
iat-in-the-future tokens are rejected. THEN the token is bound to the body:
`claims.eventId === body.eventId` AND
`claims.orderNumber === body.orderNumber` — one token authorizes exactly
one fetch of exactly one order. Every failure is the same generic
`401 Unauthorized.` (no oracle for which check failed); tokens, headers,
and secrets are never logged.

**Supabase access (read-only guarantee):** two GETs with explicit column
lists — `orders?order_number=eq.<n>&select=<fixed columns>&limit=1`, then
`order_items?order_id=eq.<uuid>&select=<fixed columns>`. Server-only env:
`VITE_SUPABASE_URL` (public project URL, same convention as every route) +
`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (never `VITE_*`, never client-side, never
returned or logged). The handler contains NO insert/update/upsert/delete/
RPC — `npm run test:order-details` asserts every outgoing call is a GET.

**Response contract** (mapped field-by-field — never raw rows; `id`,
`client_request_id`, and any unlisted column can never leak):

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "eventId": "...",
    "order": {
      "orderNumber": "TP-...", "channel": "customer|staff|null",
      "orderType": "...", "status": "...(DB vocabulary, e.g. completed)",
      "paymentStatus": "...", "paymentMethod": "...|null",
      "customerName": "...|null", "customerPhone": "...|null",
      "deliveryAddress": "...|null", "tableNumber": "...|null",
      "customerNote": "...|null", "subtotal": 0, "deliveryFee": 0,
      "total": 0, "createdAt": "ISO-8601"
    },
    "items": [
      {"itemCode": "B01", "itemName": "...", "quantity": 1,
       "unitPrice": 0, "lineTotal": 0}
    ]
  }
}
```

Amounts are THB numbers (Postgres numeric strings coerced); `channel` is
mapped from `orders.source` (`customer_menu`→customer,
`staff_manual`→staff, anything else → null).

**Errors:** 400 invalid body · 401 any auth failure (generic) · 404 order
not found · 405 non-POST · 413 body too large · 415 wrong content type ·
500 server not configured · 502 Supabase read failed. Bodies are always
`{"ok":false,"error":"<generic message>"}` — no Supabase text, no stack, no
claim/secret details.

**n8n workflow update (do AFTER the endpoint is deployed):** insert one
HTTP Request node ("Fetch Authoritative Order Details") into the existing
Phase 3A receiver. Retry-safe node sequence — the dedup row is inserted
ONLY after the fetch succeeded, so a transient Vercel/Supabase failure
leaves no dedup row and the event can be safely retried; inserting first
would permanently block a retry for an order that was never fetched:

```
Receive Order Event
  → Validate Event Claims
  → Look Up Event ID          (dedup LOOKUP: stop if already processed)
  → Fetch Authoritative Order Details   (this endpoint)
  → Insert Event Row          (dedup INSERT — only after a 200)
```

- Method POST, URL `https://third-place-menu.vercel.app/api/automation/order-details`
  (for Preview testing, the Preview deployment URL instead).
- Header `Authorization`: forward the incoming header verbatim —
  `{{ $('Receive Order Event').item.json.headers.authorization }}`
  ("Receive Order Event" is the webhook node's actual name; the normalized
  lowercase `headers.authorization` shape is the same one the Phase 3A
  JWT-node step already documents). ASSUMPTION to confirm during the first
  Preview execution: header keys arrive lowercased on n8n Cloud.
- JSON body: `{"eventId": "<validated eventId claim>", "orderNumber":
  "<validated orderNumber claim>"}` — from the VERIFIED claims, not the raw
  request body.
- Never: put a Supabase key or `N8N_AUTOMATION_SECRET` in this node,
  re-sign or reconstruct the JWT, send the token in query parameters, or
  log/store the token in the Data Table. On non-200, stop the branch
  (Continue On Fail OFF) — later bot/notification nodes only ever see the
  safe response. The 120 s token lifetime means the fetch must stay
  immediately after validation — never behind a Wait node.

**Verification (Preview):** deploy the branch as a Preview → point ONE
disposable n8n execution (or curl with a freshly generated test token) at
`<preview-url>/api/automation/order-details` → place one disposable order →
confirm n8n receives the mapped payload with correct totals/items, and that
replaying the same call after ~2.5 min gets 401 (token expired). Probe:
no Authorization → 401; garbage token → 401; valid token + mismatched
orderNumber → 401; unknown order → 404. Then check Vercel logs show only
`ORDER_DETAILS <order> event=<id> items=<n>` lines (no tokens). Promotion:
merge to main, redeploy Production, flip the n8n node URL to the production
domain. No SQL, no env changes (reuses `N8N_AUTOMATION_SECRET` +
`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` + `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` already set for 3A/2G).

**Rollback:** remove/disable the n8n HTTP Request node branch, then revert
the endpoint commit (or leave it — with the secret unset it answers only
safe 500s). Phase 3A validation/dedup keeps working unchanged; order intake
and restaurant operations are untouched either way.

**Remaining risks:** the JWT is bearer-forwardable within its 120 s + 30 s
tolerance window — anyone holding a leaked token could fetch THAT one
order's details (mitigation: n8n must not log/store tokens; HTTPS
everywhere; short lifetime). No replay counter on this endpoint itself —
n8n's Data Table dedup is the replay gate for the WORKFLOW, while repeated
fetches of the same order within the window are read-only and idempotent.
Endpoint enumerates nothing: order numbers not bound to a valid signed
token are unreachable.

### Phase 3C — selective automation dispatch (2026-07-17)

Code on branch (`api/_lib/orderEventJwt.server.ts`,
`api/_lib/orderIntake.server.ts`, `api/_lib/orderDetails.server.ts`).
Purpose: **normal restaurant orders cost zero n8n executions.** Dine-in QR,
ordinary website checkout, and staff manual orders no longer emit the Phase
3A `order.created` event at all; only server-resolved BOT channels dispatch.

**Dispatch policy (server-side only, one auditable place):**

- `ORDER_EVENT_CHANNELS` (orderEventJwt.server.ts) — the full signed
  vocabulary: `customer`, `staff`, `instagram`, `messenger`. The JWT
  verifier rejects anything else (unknown values, wrong casing, empty,
  missing, non-string).
- `AUTOMATION_DISPATCH_CHANNELS` / `isAutomationChannel()` — ONLY
  `instagram` and `messenger` are dispatch-eligible. Enforced at the intake
  call site AND re-checked inside `fireOrderAutomation` (no future caller
  can bypass it).
- Eligibility is never derived from a query parameter, body field, order
  type, or any other client-controlled value. **No public route can create
  a bot-channel order yet** — trusted bot sessions are a LATER phase, so
  after 3C the bridge is silent in production until then.
- `SOURCE_TO_CHANNEL` (orderDetails.server.ts) gained forward mappings
  `instagram`/`messenger` for `orders.source` values that only the future
  bot-session intake will write. Current rows (`customer_menu`,
  `staff_manual`) map exactly as before.

**Unchanged (verified by `npm run test:bridge`):** order creation, order
numbers, price computation, `client_request_id` idempotency (duplicate
replays never dispatched before and still don't), customer/staff responses,
`waitUntil` best-effort delivery + 5 s timeout for eligible dispatches,
failure isolation (n8n down never fails an order), safe logging (no
secrets/JWTs/hostnames). JWT validation is unweakened: HS256 pinned,
iss/aud/sub/jti/exp/nbf/iat, timingSafeEqual, generic 401s, claim↔body
binding.

**Requires:** NO database migration, NO n8n workflow change, NO env change,
NO frontend change. Existing `N8N_ORDER_AUTOMATION_WEBHOOK_URL` +
`N8N_AUTOMATION_SECRET` semantics keep working — unsetting them remains the
global emergency dispatch-off switch.

**Verification (Preview):** place one disposable customer order and one
staff order → both succeed, Vercel logs show `ORDER_INTAKE` but NO
`ORDER_AUTOMATION` line, n8n executions list shows nothing new.
`npm run test:bridge` + `npm run test:order-details` green.

**Rollback:** revert the Phase 3C commit (restores dispatch-on-every-order),
or unset the two automation env vars (dispatch off entirely). No SQL, no
data migration — the gate is stateless.

**Next phase:** pre-pilot security hardening (dashboard reads off the anon
key, `/staff`+`/owner` gating) — immediately after 3C, before bot sessions.

### Pre-Pilot Security Hardening — protected dashboard reads (2026-07-17)

Closes runbook QA-4 / schema-notes "revisit before real restaurant use":
**orders, order_items, payment_proofs, and expenses were anonymously
readable** (permissive anon SELECT policies + grants created during 2D/2E
parity QA), and the verified live snapshot also found unnecessary broader
anon/authenticated table privileges (blocked by RLS but still needless
surface). The anon key ships in the client bundle, exposing customer
names/phones/addresses, proofs, and money data. `/staff` and `/owner` had
no access gate beyond URL secrecy.

**New read architecture (browser never reads sensitive tables again):**

- `GET /api/staff/orders` — orders + order_items + payment_proofs snapshot;
  `GET /api/staff/expenses` — today's (Bangkok) expenses. One shared
  implementation `api/_lib/staffDashboardReads.server.ts` (dual-surface like
  every route: `api/staff/*.ts` production, `src/routes/api.staff.*.ts`
  dev). Both require the existing `x-staff-secret`; generic 401 otherwise;
  GET-only (other verbs 405); explicit column lists (no `select=*`);
  rows copied FIELD-BY-FIELD so unlisted columns can never leak; Supabase
  failures → one generic 502; `Cache-Control: no-store`; no secrets logged.
- Frontend: `src/lib/data/staffReadClient.ts` (GET + `x-staff-secret` from
  the existing localStorage ⚿ slot; throws typed `StaffAccessError` on
  missing/rejected secret). `supabaseOrdersAdapter.listOrders` and
  `supabaseExpensesAdapter.listExpenses` now call the protected routes; all
  existing mappers/joins are UNCHANGED, so dashboard data is byte-equivalent
  (`npm run test:dashboard-parity` proves it on fixtures). Staff 5s poll,
  chime/banner, optimistic writes, and owner manual-refresh behavior are
  untouched.
- `/staff` and `/owner` gate (`src/components/staff/AccessGate.tsx`): no
  dashboard content renders until the shared secret is entered (same
  ⚿ prompt + localStorage slot; owner uses the SAME shared secret for the
  pilot). A rejected secret (server 401) shows the gate with a "key
  rejected" message — never data, never a raw error. The gate is UX; the
  SERVER check on every read/write is the enforcement. No secret in URLs,
  HTML, or anywhere but the existing localStorage slot.
- PUBLIC MENU UNCHANGED: `menu_items` keeps its 2G-H column-limited anon
  read (7 public columns) — the customer menu needs no secret. The intake
  routes, staff writes, and Phase 3C selective dispatch are untouched; n8n
  is untouched.

**Pilot limitation (accepted, replace after pilot):** one SHARED secret for
staff + owner on trusted devices, compared server-side against
`STAFF_WRITE_SECRET`. No per-user accounts, no roles, no revocation short of
rotating the secret. Replace with real staff accounts (e.g. Supabase Auth)
after the pilot. Rotate the secret whenever it is displayed anywhere
(standing rule from 2G-E).

**Migration (review-first, NOT yet applied):**
`docs/sql/2026-07-17-pre-pilot-security-hardening.sql` — revokes all
anon/authenticated table privileges and drops the anon SELECT policies on
the four sensitive tables (dynamic lookup — the QA policies were created ad hoc),
keeps RLS enabled, preserves the menu_items public read and all
service_role access. Includes verification SQL, live curl probes, and full
rollback SQL. **Run order: deploy the hardened app code FIRST, then run the
migration** (until it runs, the anon exposure remains open but the app
already uses the protected routes; after it runs, stale cached frontends
lose reads until hard-refreshed).

**Preview verification checklist:**

- [ ] `npm run test:dashboard` + `npm run test:dashboard-parity` green.
- [ ] Preview deploy: `/staff` and `/owner` show the access gate; wrong key
      → "key rejected", NO data; correct key → boards identical to
      production (spot-check one delivery + one cancelled order + today's
      totals).
- [ ] `GET <preview>/api/staff/orders` without the header → 401 JSON;
      `POST` → 405.
- [ ] Customer menu loads with NO secret; checkout works.
- [ ] Staff writes (status/paid/cancel/expense/availability) still work.
- [ ] Vercel logs show `DASHBOARD_READ` lines with counts only.
- [ ] AFTER merging + Production deploy: run the SQL file in the Supabase
      SQL editor, run its § 3 verification (incl. the anon curl probes),
      hard-refresh the staff iPad and owner device.

**Rollback:** app — revert the branch (adapters return to anon reads),
redeploy. DB — only if the migration was already applied, run its § 4
rollback block (recreates only the permissive anon SELECT policies + grants,
never the unnecessary broader privileges). The two
must go together only for a FULL rollback; the app rollback alone is safe
before the migration runs.

### Phase 3D — secure bot sessions & secure menu links (2026-07-22)

Code on branch `feat/3d-secure-bot-sessions`. Migration PREPARED, **NOT
APPLIED**: `docs/sql/2026-07-22-3D-bot-sessions.sql`, gated behind the
read-only `docs/sql/2026-07-22-3D-bot-sessions-precheck.sql` (see "Migration
sequence" below — run the pre-check first, always). Purpose: give a trusted
simulated Instagram/Messenger conversation a one-time secure menu link that
opens the approved customer menu, can be reopened before checkout, is consumed
by exactly ONE order, and **cannot be forged by a browser**.

**Secure link format — `${PUBLIC_SITE_URL}/m#<token>`.** The token is in the
URL FRAGMENT. Fragments are never sent in an HTTP request line (RFC 3986 §
3.5) and are always stripped from `Referer`, so the token reaches no Vercel /
CDN / proxy / WAF access log, no link-preview crawler, and no error reporter.
`/m/<token>` and `/m?token=` were both rejected for exactly this reason —
note that `src/lib/lovable-error-reporting.ts` ships
`window.location.pathname` to an external sink, which with a path token would
have exported live credentials. There is ONE browser route (`src/routes/m.tsx`)
and the edge only ever sees `GET /m`.

Browser handling (`src/lib/menuSessionToken.ts`): capture the fragment
synchronously during first render → validate `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{43}$` → bridge
through `sessionStorage["tp_menu_session"]` (never localStorage) → strip the
fragment via TanStack Router `navigate({ hash: "", replace: true })`. The
bridge is what keeps refresh and iOS tab-restore working after the strip; it
is cleared on every terminal state. Reopening from browser history after the
tab was closed is the one capability given up — the chat thread holds the
durable link.

**Token derivation is DETERMINISTIC** (`BOT_SESSION_TOKEN_SECRET`, separate
from the inbound `BOT_SESSION_SECRET`): HMAC-SHA256 over a length-prefixed,
0x1F-separated canonical input of `atlas.botsession.v1` + platform + chat id +
requestId, base64url, 43 chars. Supabase stores ONLY `sha256(token)` as hex.
Determinism exists so a LOST HTTP RESPONSE can be retried and reproduce the
identical link — a random token could not be, because only its hash is stored.
On retry the server re-derives, and `create_bot_session` compares the
recomputed hash against the stored one, raising `SESSION_TOKEN_UNRECOVERABLE`
rather than returning a dead URL if the secret was rotated (fail closed).

**Concurrency:** `create_bot_session` takes `pg_advisory_xact_lock` on a
namespaced, length-prefixed (platform, chat) key BEFORE the request_id lookup.
Transaction-scoped, never session-scoped: PostgREST runs on pooled
connections, so a session-scoped lock would leak onto the connection on any
raise. Same request id → same session, `duplicate: true`, identical token/URL.
Different request ids → the later committer wins and revokes the earlier
link (the customer sees the "replaced" panel). The unique partial index
`bot_sessions_one_active_per_chat` stays as the final integrity backstop, with
a defensive `unique_violation` handler behind it.

**Checkout is atomic:** `create_order_from_bot_session` does
`SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the session, rejects revoked/expired/consumed, calls
`create_order_with_items` **with the platform from the locked row**, and marks
the session completed with its order id — all in ONE transaction.
`orders.client_request_id` alone is NOT sufficient here: two browser tabs
generate two different requestIds, so both inserts would otherwise succeed.

**Additive only:** `create_order_with_items` gained the `instagram`/`messenger`
channel branches (sources `instagram`/`messenger`, prefixes `TP-IG-`/`TP-MS-`)
and an `order_id` key in all three return objects. Customer/staff behaviour,
prices, order numbers and idempotency are unchanged — proven by the migration's
§ 8 regression and by `npm run test:bridge`.

**Unchanged:** normal customer and staff orders still cost ZERO n8n executions
(`AUTOMATION_DISPATCH_CHANNELS` was already `instagram`/`messenger` and needed
no edit); Owner Menu stays read-only; the approved customer-menu design is
byte-identical (the `MenuScreen` extraction is a verified pure move — the only
delta across 293 lines is the added `session` prop).

**Requires:** the § 1–6 migration, plus `BOT_SESSION_SECRET`,
`BOT_SESSION_TOKEN_SECRET`, `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (and optionally
`MESSENGER_PAGE_HANDLE` / `INSTAGRAM_HANDLE`) in the server environment.
NO n8n workflow change. NO change to any existing route's behaviour.

**Deployment order:** run the SQL FIRST (as with 2G-H / 2G-I), then deploy.
Rollback is the REVERSE — revert/redeploy the app, then run § 11. Getting that
backwards takes the secure-link route down.

**Migration sequence — follow in this exact order:**

1. **Run the pre-check file on its own:**
   `docs/sql/2026-07-22-3D-bot-sessions-precheck.sql`. It is READ-ONLY (14
   SELECTs against catalog/information_schema; zero mutating statements) and is
   safe against Production. It is a SEPARATE file precisely so that one
   paste-and-run cannot execute the check *and* apply the migration before
   anyone reads the result.
2. **Review and classify EVERY returned row.** A returned row is **not**
   automatically a blocker — classify each by its actual definition using the
   interpretation guidance printed beside each section. Only these block:
   - a CHECK, ENUM or DOMAIN on `orders.source` that excludes `instagram` or
     `messenger` (§ A / § C — note § C must be read **even if § A returns
     nothing**, because an enum-backed column produces no table CHECK row);
   - `orders.order_number` with `character_maximum_length` below 23 (§ B —
     `TP-IG-`/`TP-MS-` raise the longest possible order number from 20 to 23);
   - a trigger that rejects or rewrites `source`/`order_number` (§ D);
   - `create_order_with_items` not matching the 2G-I baseline, or
     `public.bot_sessions` already existing (§ E).
   Complete the § F decision checklist and record the outputs in the runbook
   notes — they are the only evidence the migration was safe to apply.
3. **Apply the main migration only after that approval:**
   `docs/sql/2026-07-22-3D-bot-sessions.sql` §§ 1–6. Its first executable
   statement is the `begin;` in § 1; there is no executable pre-check above it.
4. **Run § 7 verification** (read-only): expect 0 policies, 0
   anon/authenticated grants, `service_role` with SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE and no
   DELETE, three functions SECURITY INVOKER with pinned `search_path`, and 0
   advisory locks held.
5. **Run the § 8 normal-order regression twice** — same `TP-` number both
   times, `duplicate` false then true, `source='customer_menu'` — then clean up.
6. **Run the § 9 and § 10 tests on a branch/staging project only, never
   Production.** § 10 needs two simultaneous connections (two psql windows; SQL
   Editor tabs autocommit per statement and will not reproduce the race).

**Preview verification checklist:**

- [ ] `npm run test:bot-session`, `test:bridge`, `test:order-details`,
      `test:dashboard`, `test:dashboard-parity` green.
- [ ] `docs/sql/2026-07-22-3D-bot-sessions-precheck.sql` has been run on its
      own, every returned row classified by its actual definition (a row is
      NOT automatically a blocker), and its § F decision checklist completed
      and recorded — all before anything is applied.
- [ ] Migration § 8 normal-order regression: a `customer` order still gets a
      `TP-` number and `source='customer_menu'`.
- [ ] Migration § 10 concurrency tests C1–C5 on a BRANCH/STAGING project.
- [ ] Preview: `/` pixel-identical to Production (hero, rails, stagger, cart
      tray, checkout sheet).
- [ ] Preview: create a session via `/api/automation/bot-session`, open the
      link, confirm the address bar shows `/m` with NO token, refresh, reopen,
      check out, reopen → completed panel, attempt a second checkout → refused.
- [ ] Vercel logs show `GET /m` only (never a token), plus `BOT_SESSION
      created`, `MENU_SESSION_RESOLVE state=…`, `SESSION_ORDER …` lines with
      no token, hash, chat id, or secret.
- [ ] One normal customer order in Preview → `ORDER_INTAKE` but NO
      `ORDER_AUTOMATION`; n8n executions list shows nothing new.

### Production test checklist after the 2G-F/2G-G deploy

1. ⚿ on each staff device: enter the CURRENT rotated secret.
2. Staff board: advance a TEST order's status (create via Add Order first,
   as in 2G-E), mark paid Cash, cancel with a reason — all from the UI; the
   board must update and survive the 5s poll.
3. Expenses: add `TEST EXPENSE 2G-G` (small amount, category Other) from
   the staff Expenses view; it must appear in the list (Supabase read) and
   in Supabase Table Editor with description/payment_method/staff_name/
   expense_date correct. Then DELETE that row in Table Editor (expenses
   have no cancelled state — the row otherwise pollutes owner Net Today).
4. Owner dashboard: manual refresh — numbers sane; the cancelled test order
   excluded; after deleting the test expense, Net Today back to normal.
5. Customer checkout: place NO real test order via checkout unless needed —
   intake is unchanged (n8n); a quick page-load check is enough.
6. n8n executions list: status/payment/expense webhooks should now show NO
   new executions from app actions (only bots/manual runs) — confirms the
   app stopped depending on them while they stay alive as fallback.

## Phase 2H — n8n keeps the automation jobs (end state)

- n8n permanently retains: Instagram/Messenger/LINE/WeChat bot conversations,
  payment-proof intake (writes proof fields the dashboard reads), customer
  notifications, other automation.
- n8n stops being the app's query engine; dashboard reads/writes are Supabase.
- Retire dead read/write webhooks + the n8n adapters only after a full stable
  period, in their own cleanup commit.

---

## Rollback plan (any phase, any time)

1. Set `ACTIVE_READ_SOURCE` back to `"n8n"` in `src/lib/data/dataSource.ts`
   (one line; if `ACTIVE_WRITE_SOURCE` was ever flipped too — Phase 2G+ —
   revert it the same way).
2. Redeploy. Nothing else changes — the n8n adapters were never modified.
3. Writes: unchanged if rollback happens before 2G; if a write was migrated,
   revert that write's switch too — the n8n write path is kept intact until 2H.
4. Owner dashboard manual refresh and staff polling were never touched, so no
   behavioral rollback is needed there.
5. Post-rollback: capture the parity mismatch/failure that forced it into the
   risk register below before retrying.

---

## Risk register

| # | Risk | Prevention | Test that catches it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Status vocabulary mismatch** — DB stores values the app doesn't know (e.g. `completed`, or something new) | Discovery step 3 captures exact values; `normalizeOrderStatus` maps known aliases explicitly and falls back to `new`, never to done/cancelled; `DB_STATUS_USES_COMPLETED` set from evidence | Parity: `status` compared by value on every order; a wrong status also shows as an order stuck in "New" |
| 2 | **Item JSON vs item table difference** — items stored differently than assumed, orders render with 0 items | Discovery step 1 answers jsonb-vs-table; `parseOrderItems` returns `[]` (never phantom lines) on shape surprise | Parity: `items.length` + per-line name/quantity/unitPrice checks |
| 3 | **Timezone/date mismatch** — Supabase timestamps in UTC vs Airtable local, owner "today" windows shift | Discovery step 8 copies a real timestamp verbatim; keep timestamps as raw ISO strings through the mapper (no reformatting) | Parity with `strictTimestamps: true`; manual check that an order placed "now" appears in owner Today on both sources |
| 4 | **Money string vs number** — Postgres numeric serializes as `"150.00"`, totals become 0 or NaN | `normalizeMoney` accepts clean numeric strings, rejects formatted junk to 0 (loud in diffs); discovery step 9 confirms column types | Parity: `totalPrice`/`subtotalPrice`/`deliveryFee`/`amount`/`unitPrice` compared by value |
| 5 | **cancelled/delivered/done vocabulary drift** — `delivered` merged into `done` or cancel writes a different value | Contract forbids merging (orderContract.ts §1, §8); cancel flow columns captured in discovery step 3 | Parity on a day containing delivery + cancelled orders; owner Cancelled-Today count matches |
| 6 | **Payment proof storage mismatch** — proof is a Storage bucket path/attachment, not a URL column; links 404 | Discovery step 6 identifies the real storage; mapper only ever emits a usable URL or `undefined` (never a raw bucket path) | Parity: `hasPaymentProof`/`paymentProofUrl` by value; manually click one proof link from Supabase data |
| 7 | **Expenses table mismatch** — column names differ from the POST payload's snake_case guess | Discovery step 7 verifies instead of assuming; `SupabaseExpenseRow` aligned before any query is written | Parity on expenses; unknown paidFrom/category surfacing as "Other" spike is the visible symptom |
| 8 | **Owner report totals mismatch** — subtle field drift (paidAt fallback, cancelled exclusion) shifts money numbers | All totals are pure frontend math over the normalized shape — parity on the shape implies parity on totals; no total logic changes during migration | Same-day owner dashboard opened against both sources (dev vs prod): gross, net, payment mix, best sellers identical |
| 9 | **n8n and Supabase temporarily disagreeing** — comparing while orders are actively arriving produces false mismatches; or during dual-running, one side is stale | Run parity in a quiet window; re-run on mismatch before investigating; never cache one side's fetch | `missingInCandidate`/`extraInCandidate` lists in the parity result make in-flight rows identifiable by orderId |
| 10 | **Writes migrated too early** — a write moves to Supabase before the n8n automation that listened to it is re-pointed; notifications/bot replies silently stop | Hard phase gate: writes only in 2G, one at a time, each with an automation-dependency check first; write methods stay throwing stubs until then | After each write migration: perform the action, then verify the downstream automation fired (notification received, proof flow works) |
