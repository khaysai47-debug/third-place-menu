# Adapter Parity Testing (Phase 2D)

**Status:** RUNNABLE — Phase 2C is done: `supabaseOrdersAdapter.listOrders()`
and `supabaseExpensesAdapter.listExpenses()` are implemented (reads only;
writes still throw until Phase 2G).

**Prerequisites:**

1. Add to `.env.local` (never commit values):

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://<project-ref>.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon public key — NEVER the service_role key>
```

2. The anon role must be able to SELECT the four read tables.
   ✅ DONE 2026-07-06: `GRANT SELECT ON public.orders TO anon;` and
   `GRANT SELECT ON public.order_items TO anon;` were executed, plus
   anon SELECT RLS policies (`USING (true)`) on both tables.
   `expenses` ALSO needed the same treatment (found during QA-1 — it
   returned 200 with rows silently filtered to empty until
   `GRANT SELECT ON public.expenses TO anon;` and policy
   `anon_select_expenses_for_parity FOR SELECT TO anon USING (true)` were
   added). Lesson: a 200-with-empty-rows can be missing grants/RLS, not
   missing data. `payment_proofs` readability gets its real test in QA-2.
   (Security note: anon SELECT means anyone with the public anon key can read
   order data. This is equivalent exposure to the existing public n8n
   staff-orders GET webhook, so nothing new — but the whole RLS/security
   posture must be reviewed before real restaurant use, and writes must
   NEVER be granted to anon.)

`ACTIVE_READ_SOURCE` / `ACTIVE_WRITE_SOURCE` stay `"n8n"` throughout — the
live app never touches Supabase during parity testing.

**Goal:** prove, on the same underlying data, that the Supabase adapter's
normalized output is identical to the live n8n adapter's output — *before*
`ACTIVE_READ_SOURCE` is ever flipped.

**Tooling:** `src/lib/data/dev/adapterParity.ts` — pure compare functions,
no I/O, imported by nothing in the app. The companion human checklist is
`docs/adapter-contract-checklist.md`.

## How to run it (Node script — the normal way)

```
npm run parity              # presence-mode timestamps
npm run parity -- --strict  # strict timestamp value comparison
```

`scripts/run-parity.mjs` loads the real runner module
(`src/lib/data/dev/runParity.ts`) through Vite's SSR module loader — the same
adapters, mappers, and `.env.local` env the app would use — but executes it in
Node, where browser CORS does not apply. No new dependency; nothing enters any
bundle. Exit code 0 = both domains `ok: true`; 1 = mismatch or fetch failure.

The runner fetches both adapters for both domains, logs a summary per domain,
then a `[coverage]` block showing what the day's data actually exercised
(statuses, order types, payment methods, proof/expense counts) and which gate
scenarios are still missing — parity can pass on thin data, coverage says how
thin. It also reports `fetchErrors` per source. One source failing (missing env,
permission denial, network) skips only that domain's comparison — the other
still runs. A permission denial looks like
`Supabase read failed: orders responded 401` (fix: the GRANT in the
prerequisites above; an empty-but-200 result means RLS filtering — compare
counts against the staff board).

### Browser console (alternative — has a CORS catch)

The same runner works from the devtools console of an `npm run dev` session:

```js
const m = await import("/src/lib/data/dev/runParity.ts");
await m.runAdapterParity();
```

⚠️ CORS limitation: n8n Cloud does not send CORS headers for localhost
origins, so the **n8n side fails in the browser** (`blocked by CORS`) unless
the n8n webhooks set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`. The Supabase side works
(Supabase sends permissive CORS). This is why the Node script is the normal
way; use the browser path only if n8n CORS is ever opened for localhost.
(This also means the deployed staff/owner pages work only because they are
served from an origin n8n accepts — local `/staff` against n8n Cloud fails
the same way, which is a dev-only limitation, not a production bug.)

## Known differences — status

- **Expenses `itemName` / `createdBy` / `id(rowKey)`** — PREDICTED, then
  CONFIRMED and FIXED during QA-1 (2026-07-06). The Supabase-backed n8n Get
  Expenses output emits `expense_id`/`description`/`staff_name` and no
  `id`/`item_name`/`created_by` (verified against the live webhook), so the
  frontend's Airtable-era mapper rendered blank expense names and empty React
  list keys IN THE LIVE APP. Resolution: the fix went into the live frontend
  mapper (`mapApiExpense` in src/lib/expenses.ts) — additive fallbacks
  `id ← id || expense_id`, `itemName ← item_name || description`,
  `createdBy ← created_by || staff_name` — because staff/owner UIs display
  itemName and key lists by id. This repaired the live display regression AND
  made both adapters emit identical real values. The Supabase adapter was NOT
  dumbed down to match broken output.
- **Order item ordering**: the Supabase adapter orders lines by
  `order_items.created_at`; if n8n emits a different line order, per-index
  item mismatches appear even though the sets are identical. (Not observed in
  any run so far.)

## Full procedure (do all six, in order)

1. **Fetch current n8n output** — `n8nOrdersAdapter.listOrders()` /
   `n8nExpensesAdapter.listExpenses()` (this is exactly what production shows).
2. **Fetch Supabase output behind the inactive adapter** — call the Supabase
   adapter *directly* (as above). `ACTIVE_READ_SOURCE` stays `"n8n"` the whole
   time; calling the inactive adapter directly is the point.
3. **Normalize both** — automatic: both adapters return normalized shapes.
   If you find yourself massaging data *outside* an adapter to make parity
   pass, the adapter is wrong — fix it there.
4. **Compare parity** — `compareOrdersForParity` / `compareExpensesForParity`,
   then `summarizeParityResult`. Timestamps are compared by presence first;
   re-run with `{ strictTimestamps: true }` once formats are confirmed equal.
5. **Review mismatches** — every line in the summary is either (a) a Supabase
   adapter/mapper bug → fix and re-run, or (b) a real upstream data difference
   → resolve in the n8n/Supabase workflow first. Zero unexplained lines is the
   bar. Check counts on a day with real variety: delivery + cancelled +
   paid-by-transfer + payment-proof orders.
6. **Only then flip reads** — Phase 2E in docs/backend-separation-runbook.md.
   (Nothing to delete: the runner lives in `src/lib/data/dev/` and is never
   bundled; it stays as regression tooling.)

## Pass criteria

- `ok: true` for both domains, on at least two different days of data.
- One run with `strictTimestamps: true` passing, or a written note explaining
  the accepted timestamp format difference.
- The human checklist (docs/adapter-contract-checklist.md) also walked once.

## Run log

| Date | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-07-06 | ✅ PASS (normal AND `--strict`) | orders: 38/38 clean matches (incl. delivery, cancelled, transfer-paid, completed dine-in). expenses: 0 vs 0 — trivially equal; **must re-run on a day with real expense rows before this counts**. Strict timestamps passing means n8n passes Supabase timestamps through verbatim — no format note needed. |
| 2026-07-06 (QA-1) | ✅ PASS after two fixes (normal AND `--strict`) | Real ฿1 test expense added via staff UI. First run: candidate 0 expenses — `expenses` lacked anon GRANT + RLS policy (added manually, see prerequisites). Second run: 3 field mismatches (`itemName`/`createdBy`/`id`) — the predicted n8n-output/frontend-mapper key drift; fixed in the live frontend mapper (see "Known differences"). Final: orders 38/38, expenses **1/1 clean**. Remaining coverage gap: payment proof only (QA-2). |

Still open before the Phase 2E flip: a second day of order data, an expenses
run with real rows, a payment-proof order (none exist yet), and one walk of
the human checklist. Exact procedures below. Reads don't flip until the
Phase 2E gate in docs/backend-separation-runbook.md is fully checked; writes
stay on n8n until Phase 2G regardless.

## Final pre-flip QA — exact procedures

Work through these in order; each ends with a parity run whose `[coverage]`
block should show the corresponding gap disappearing. Log each result in the
Run log above.

### QA-1 · Real-expense parity  ✅ DONE 2026-07-06 (see Run log)

1. Open the deployed staff page → Expenses view, and add a small expense
   through the normal form: item name `PARITY TEST — safe to delete`,
   amount `1`, category `Other`, paid from `Cash`, note optional.
   (This is a normal n8n write — writes are on n8n, that's the point.)
2. Confirm it appears in the staff expense list and in the owner dashboard's
   expense section (manual refresh).
3. Same Bangkok day, run `npm run parity` and `npm run parity -- --strict`.
4. Expect: `[parity:expenses] OK` with counts ≥ 1 on both sides, and the
   coverage gap "no expense rows" gone. Any mismatch here is adjudicated the
   usual way — note the parity doc's "Known differences" section: the n8n
   Get Expenses output may emit keys the frontend mapper doesn't read
   (`itemName`/`createdBy`/row key) — if those mismatch, the fix is the n8n
   output mapping, not the Supabase adapter.
5. Cleanup policy: the row is ฿1 and clearly labeled — keep it until the flip
   is done (it is useful for the second-day run), then delete it in the
   Supabase Table Editor (`expenses` table; no child rows) if the owner
   doesn't want it in reports. Deleting there removes it from BOTH read paths
   (n8n reads the same database).

### QA-2 · Payment-proof parity

Verified facts (2026-07-06): there is NO production UI that adds a payment
proof — the app only displays proof fields; the `third-place-add-payment-proof`
n8n webhook exists for the future bot flow. So the safest way to create one
test row is a one-off POST to that webhook (again: a write via n8n).

1. Pick a safe test order: in the Supabase Table Editor → `orders`, choose an
   old finished test row (e.g. a July 3–5 `completed` order), and copy its
   **`id` (UUID)** — NOT `order_number`. `payment_proofs.order_id` joins on
   `orders.id`; the staff API matches `proof.order_id === order.id`.
2. POST to the webhook (PowerShell; URL base = your `VITE_N8N_BASE_URL`):

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Uri "https://<your-n8n-host>/webhook/third-place-add-payment-proof" `
  -Body (@{
    order_id  = "<orders.id UUID>"
    proof_url = "https://example.com/parity-test-proof.jpg"
    source    = "parity-test"
    status    = "received"
    note      = "PARITY TEST - safe to delete"
  } | ConvertTo-Json)
```

   (`proof_file_path` may be omitted — n8n defaults it to `""`.)
3. Run `npm run parity`. Expect: still `OK`, the chosen order shows
   `hasPaymentProof`/`paymentProofUrl` matching on BOTH sides, and coverage
   shows `proofs=1`.
4. ⚠ This is the first time the n8n Staff Orders API's proof output is
   exercised with a real row (discovery never observed one). If parity
   MISMATCHES on proof fields, that is the test doing its job: compare the
   n8n output keys against the Supabase adapter's mapping
   (`latestPaymentProof` in orderMapper.ts) and fix whichever side is wrong —
   do not flip until clean.
5. Optional visual check: the staff order card and owner order detail should
   show the proof link (deployed app, since local n8n reads are CORS-blocked).
6. Cleanup: delete the row in Supabase Table Editor → `payment_proofs`
   (find it by `source = 'parity-test'`; it has no child rows). Keep it until
   after the flip verification if convenient.

### QA-3 · Second-day parity

1. On a different service day with fresh orders (ideally: ≥1 dine-in,
   ≥1 delivery, ≥1 cancelled, one cash-paid, one transfer-paid — the
   `[coverage]` block tells you what the day actually contains), run both
   `npm run parity` and `npm run parity -- --strict` in a quiet moment
   (not while orders are actively arriving — risk register #9).
2. Expect `ok: true` on both domains. Log the run (date, counts, coverage
   gaps remaining) in the Run log above.

### QA-4 · RLS / security review (decision, not code)

Current state (2026-07-06): anon has SELECT on all four read tables
(`orders`/`order_items` granted + permissive `USING (true)` policies for
parity; `payment_proofs`/`expenses` were already readable). **No anon writes
exist — keep it that way.** Exposure today equals the public n8n
staff-orders GET webhook, so the flip makes nothing worse.

Before REAL restaurant use (regardless of flip), decide and record here:

- [ ] Is public read of all orders acceptable long-term? (Likely no —
      customer PII: names, phones, addresses.)
- [ ] Options, in increasing effort: stricter RLS policies; staff/owner
      auth (password/session) in front of the dashboards; moving Supabase
      reads behind a backend API so the anon key disappears from the
      browser entirely (pairs with the Phase 2G write decision).
- [ ] Also applies to n8n: the staff-orders GET webhook is equally public —
      any fix should cover both, or retire the n8n read path (Phase 2H).

Do not implement auth as part of the flip — it is a separate, deliberate
change. The flip only requires confirming: anon = read-only, service_role
lives only in n8n, no secrets in the repo.
